        <h3> To ensure security, Crimson Meet is exclusively available to Harvard students and affiliates with a valid Harvard email address. </h3> 
            
        <h3> Using the third-party platform Calendly, we collect only the essential information required for pairing students into small groups: availability, first name, and Harvard email address. Based on this information, we match you with 1â€“3 other Harvard students for a lunch or coffee meetup and connect you through your Harvard email.</h3> 
            
        <h3> Please note: Crimson Meet is not a dating platform. Our mission is to foster meaningful social connections within the Harvard community.</h3>
