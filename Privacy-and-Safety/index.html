        <h2>Privacy and Safety</h2>
        <p> Your privacy and safety are our top priorities.</p>

            <p> To ensure security, Crimson Meet is exclusively available to Harvard students and affiliates with a valid Harvard email address.</p>
            
            <p> Using the third-party platform Calendly, we collect only the essential information required for pairing students into small groups: availability, first name, and Harvard email address. Based on this information, we match you with 1â€“3 other Harvard students for a lunch or coffee meetup and connect you through your Harvard email.</p>
            
            <p> Please note: Crimson Meet is not a dating platform. Our mission is to foster meaningful, professional, and social connections within the Harvard community. </p>
