    <h2>About Crimson Connect</h2>
      <p>
        Crimson Connect is a student-led initiative designed to facilitate casual coffee or lunch meetups among Harvard students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harvard brings together students from all corners of the world and diverse walks of life. Yet, many of us find ourselves within small social bubbles, rarely connecting meaningfully with peers outside our programs, schools, or social circles. This limits opportunities to expand our worldviews and engage in enriching conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help students break out of these bubbles, Crimson Connect randomly matches users based on their availability, creating opportunities to connect meaningfully with new peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to enhance the Harvard social experience by fostering respectful exchanges of ideas, meaningful connections, and an appreciation for the diversity within the Harvard community.

      <h2>Privacy and Safety</h2>
      <p>Your privacy and safety are our top priorities. To ensure security:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only Harvard students and affiliates with Harvard email addresses are eligible to sign up.</li>
        <li>We ask for minimal data: your first name, Harvard email, and availability.</li>
        <li>Your data will be used solely for meetup matching and scheduling purposes and will be deleted after one month.</li>
      </ul>
